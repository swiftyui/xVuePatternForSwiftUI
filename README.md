# xWatch

Watch function in frontend `vuejs` is quite useful (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html#Watchers). This project is to demo how to achieve that in SwiftUI including

- watch @Binding change
- watch normal properties change
- watch @State change

Additionally, we also talk about some other iOS dedicated watch functions including

- Combine `receive` on `ObservableObject`
- Traditional `willSet/didSet`
- Outdated KVO, Notification Center and Target/Action pattern
